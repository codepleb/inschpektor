## INSCHPEKTOR

This is a vuejs app that helps you managing your IOTA node neighbors.

The app isn't officially released yet, so I don't write a big readme here. To get it flying it needs some manual tweaks.
As soon as this is handled, I would put it into an alpha state.

### Features/Improves on the roadmap:

- AddNeighbor functionality
- Manage non-UDP neighbors
- Keep database slim by removing the oldest entries
- "Current IP" in node error view
- Improve fetchneighbors algorithm (introcude promises)
- Improve database queries
- Create DB trigger for a limited amount of inserts into neighbors
